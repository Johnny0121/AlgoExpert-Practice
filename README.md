# How to run a problem?
Each problem is solved within its own individual C# class. Data structures are stored within its own `Structures` folder. To run a problem, go to `Program.cs` and call the `Run()` method of a problem class (static).

Example: Within program.cs's static main method, we're going to call the `TwoSum.cs`'s run method.
`TwoSum.Run()`
